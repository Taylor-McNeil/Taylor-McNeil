#  Software Engineer • Developer Experience • Fantasy Nerd • World Traveler

Hey, I’m Taylor – a software engineer, technical writer, and fantasy nerd. <br>
I turn complex tech mumbo jumbo into real things that solve problems. <br>
Currently focusing on front-end engineering (React/TS), but still deeply rooted in Python, API design, and docs that don’t suck.
